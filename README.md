# CSU-IMU-2023
 Basic and advanced courses on Machine learning and Data Assimilation
 
 Here you will find all the material for 2 courses that will be held at Caraga State Universit in October 2023. The IMU provided partial funding.
 
 ## Basic Course (30h)
 
 In this course we present the basic theories of
 
 - Machine Learning
 - Data Assimilation
 
 
 ## Advanced Course (30h)
 
 In this course we present more advanced materail on *Scientific Machine Learning* that couple
